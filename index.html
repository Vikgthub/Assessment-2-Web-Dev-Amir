Created approximately 4.6 billion years ago from a collapsing nebula, it primarily consists of empty space controlled by the Sun's mass, with other objects orbiting in elliptical paths.

It was discovered in 1930 and named after the Roman god of the underworld. It is a small, cold world with a thin atmosphere and five moons (Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, Styx).

          <h1>OORT CLOUD</h1>
          <p class="descriptionb">
            The Oort Cloud is a vast, theoretical spherical shell of icy bodies (comets) that surrounds the Solar System and marks its outermost boundary. It was proposed by Jan Oort in 1950 and is thought to be the source of long-period comets. It is made up of trillions of frozen water, ammonia, and methane fragments that are scattered far beyond the Kuiper Belt by giant planet gravity. It is extremely distant, potentially stretching a quarter to halfway to the next star, making direct observation difficult, although its presence is deduced from comets.

The Kármán line (about 100 km above) marks the border between air and space. It has extremely low particle density, cosmic radiation, magnetic fields, and a Big Bang-like baseline temperature. Outer space spans the entire cosmos, which is made up of dark energy, dark matter, and conventional matter, and is governed by international conventions such as the Outer Space Treaty, which encourages peaceful exploration.

Luhman 16 A and B have masses of 35.4 and 29.4 Jupiter masses, respectively, and are believed to have ages between 400 and 800 million years.

Earth is situated on one of the spiral arms of the galaxy, approximately midway to the center. Our solar system requires approximately 240 million years to complete one orbit around the Milky Way. From our viewpoint on Earth, the Milky Way appears as a dim, milky streak of light spanning the whole sky, which is the origin of its name. This attribute highlights the central disk of our home galaxy observed from the side. The Milky Way is located in an area with more than 50 other galaxies known as the Local Group. Its constituents vary in scale from dwarf galaxies (minuscule galaxies containing up to a few billion stars) to Andromeda, our closest substantial galactic neighbor. The Local Group is positioned near the boundary of the Virgo cluster and belongs to the Laniakea supercluster.

            The Andromeda Galaxy is a barred spiral galaxy and is the closest significant galaxy to the Milky Way. Initially called the Andromeda Nebula, it is listed as Messier 31, M31, and NGC 224. Andromeda features a D25 isophotal diameter close to 46.56 kiloparsecs (152,000 light-years)[8] and is situated roughly 765 kpc (2.5 million light-years) away from Earth. The name of the galaxy originates from the section of the sky above Earth where it is seen, the Andromeda constellation, named after the princess who was the spouse of Perseus in Greek mythology. The virial mass of the Andromeda Galaxy is similar in scale to that of the Milky Way, estimated at 1 trillion solar masses (2.0×10^42 kilograms). Estimating the mass of either galaxy accurately is challenging, but historically it was believed that the Andromeda Galaxy had a greater mass than the Milky Way by approximately 25% to 50%. However, early-21st-century research has raised doubts about this, suggesting that the Andromeda Galaxy might have a lower mass and the Milky Way could be more massive.

        <h1>THE OBSERVABLE UNIVERSE </h1>
        <p class="theobservableuniverse-descriptiona">

          The observable universe is the spherical area of space surrounding Earth that includes all matter whose light or signals have had sufficient time to reach us since the Big Bang, effectively forming a cosmic boundary constrained by the finite speed of light and the universe's age (approximately 13.8 billion years). It’s a sphere around Earth, having a radius of approximately 46.5 billion light-years, but it doesn’t encompass the whole universe, which could be infinite; it merely represents the part we can presently observe.
        
          <br>

          What it is:
          <br>
          - Cosmic Horizon: Similar to how a vessel at sea cannot perceive beyond the horizon, we are also unable to see past a specific point in space since light from those regions hasn't arrived here yet.
          <br>
          - Finite Age & Light's Speed: Given the universe's inception (Big Bang) and the finite speed of light, there exists a maximum distance light could have traveled to arrive at us, establishing our observable boundary.
          <br>
          - Expansion of Space: The universe is growing, causing far-off galaxies to drift away from us, elongating the light (redshift) and widening the gap to them, which explains why the observable universe exceeds 13.8 billion light-years.
          <br>
          - Not a Physical Barrier: The boundary of the observable universe isn't a barrier; it merely represents the extent of what we can perceive. Additional universe lies beyond it, but we are unable to perceive it at this time.
          <br>
          
          What Lies Within?
          It encompasses all galaxies, stars, and matter that we are able to detect at present, including the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) (the universe's oldest light).
          What's Lays Ahead?
          Anything past this horizon, which remains a section of the vast (potentially limitless) universe, is merely outside our present sight, with its light still making its way to us.

            A simple manual to the universe. This initiative is a one-page learning tool aimed at clarifying the enormity of our cosmos, thoughtfully designed to connect intricate astronomical information with human interest. In a time of excessive information, this platform acts as a minimalist refuge, removing the distractions of conventional encyclopedias to offer a concentrated, high-quality exploration of the universe. From the thermonuclear core of our Sun to the frigid, quiet expanses of the Oort Cloud and the gravitational irregularities of deep-space black holes, every data point is selected for optimal clarity and effect. By incorporating fundamental metrics—like accurate orbital distances, cosmic scales, and structural compositions—About Space converts abstract scientific ideas into a concrete visual story. It is beyond just a website; it serves as a digital representation of the known universe, tailored for students, researchers, and explorers who appreciate accuracy, sophistication, and the quest for universal knowledge in its most authentic form.  From the center of our Solar System to the farthest corners of deep space, we offer precise information on the celestial objects that are near us!
